TODO:

 * pass to lambda list of managed policies
 * create temporary role with said policies

cleanup?

 * cron based iterate over roles that have trust policy this lambda and see if 1hr has passed?
 * once role created, create single cron event to be triggered in an hour to delete this specific role and then the cron event itself (sounds complicated)
